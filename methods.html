            <h2>Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)</h2>
            <p>NWP uses mathematical models to predict weather based on current atmospheric conditions. By processing data through supercomputers, NWP creates forecasts for temperatures, wind, humidity, and other weather variables. This method is widely used by meteorological agencies worldwide.</p>
